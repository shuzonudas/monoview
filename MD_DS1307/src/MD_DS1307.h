\mainpage Arduino DS1307 Library
The Maxim DS1307 Real Time Clock IC
-----------------------------------
The DS1307 serial real-time clock (RTC) is a low-power,
full binary-coded decimal (BCD) clock/calendar plus 56 
bytes of non-volatile SRAM.

Microprocessor interface is exclusively through an I2C 
bidirectional bus.

The device 
- incorporates a battery input, and maintains timekeeping when main power 
to the device is interrupted. 
- maintains seconds, minutes, hours, day, date, month, and year information. 
- automatically adjusts dates for months with fewer than 31 days, including 
corrections for leap year. 
- operates in either the 24-hour or 12-hour format with an AM/PM indicator.
- has and frequency programmable square-wave output.

This library features access to all on-chip features
- Read and write clock time registers
- Access to the 64 byte battery backed up RAM
- Read and write alarm registers and controls
- Read/write clock and alarm registers as RAM
- Control of square wave generator (on/off & frequency)
- Control of clock features (on/off, 12/24H, day of week)

\page pageSoftware Software Overview
Using the Library
-----------------

The library has a simple interface to the RTC hardware implemented through:
- a set of time (h, m, s and dow) and date (yyyy, mm, dd) variables. All data to and from
the RTC passes through these. Clock or alarm time data is read or written to these interface
registers before the appropriate methods are invoke to act on that data.
- control() and status() methods to set and query the functionality of the RTC.

___

The Control and Status Methods
----------------------------------
The control() and status() methods are the main interface to action setting parameters or 
status values. The parameters used for each are similar, but not symmetrical, due
to the way the hardware is implemented. The table below highlights the combinations of valid 
parameters for the control() method and whether a parameter can be changed by user code.

The status() method will return the current value from the parameter nominated and is guaranteed to
be in the valid set.

 Function            |R|W| Write value
---------------------|-|-|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
DS1307_CLOCK_HALT    |Y|Y| DS1307_ON, DS1307_OFF 
DS1307_SQW_RUN       |Y|Y| DS1307_ON, DS1307_OFF
DS3231_SQW_TYPE_ON   |Y|Y| DS1307_SQW_1HZ, DS1307_SQW_4KHZ, DS1307_SQW_8KHZ, DS1307_SQW_32KHZ
DS1307_SQW_TYPE_OFF  |Y|Y| DS1307_SQW_HIGH, DS1307_SQW_LOW
DS1307_12H           |Y|Y| DS1307_ON, DS1307_OFF 

___

Working with the Current Time
-----------------------------
__Reading__ the current time from the clock is a call to the readTime() method. The current date 
and time is then available in the interface registers.

__Writing__ the current time is a sequence of writing to the interface registers followed by a call 
to the writeTime() method.

The DS1307_LCD_Time example has examples of the different ways of interacting with the RTC.
